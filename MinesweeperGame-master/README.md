Minesweeper game developed for BCIT-COMP1536's Project Requirement

For this project, the class was given a task of recreating Minesweeper using only Javascript, HTML, and CSS with no libraries allowed. The game will work similar to the original Minesweeper game. Additional requirements included having a database to store the high scores, and the functionality of retrieving and writing scores to the database. Mobile responsiveness was a must.

I decided to use HTML canvas to draw the game, and to allow the ability to further develop more features such as animations of bomb detonating. In addition, Firebase was used as a database to store high scores.

As for functionality, changing dimensions and parameters of the game board,flagging and chording (left click while holding onto right click, and vice versa) are implemented.
